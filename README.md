# Svelte Starter Template

Starter using Vite + Svelte + TypeScript with opinionated ESLint and Prettier setup.

## Motivation

Improve building your faster **prototyping** by using Vite, TypeScript, Svelte.

This starter uses following libraries:

- Vite
- Svelte
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Prettier

## Quick Setup

```shell
npx degit MASTERAMARJEET/Svelte-starter-template#base
```

## Vite

[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) is a fast frontend build tool. According to the [README](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/README.md), it consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that serves your source files over native ES modules, with rich built-in features and astonishingly fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

## Svelte

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics) is a radical new approach to building user interfaces.

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) is a superset of JavaScript. It is just one of NPM library, but it provides an original compiler.

## ESLint and Prettier

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is use to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is a code formatter.
